## Module 2 | Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

This is my very basic mock-up of how I would design a portfolio for myself. Since I do not have any examples that I have created on my own/from scratch, my previous work section will be bare. With the knowledge I currently have in CSS and javascript, I was able to hide the 'Coming soon!' text, that becomes visible when someone hovers over the box.

One skill I failed to use thus far would be assigning some of my style preferences to variables. I believe I didn't implement this at first because I would change the elements around a lot during the process, but since I stuck with a color scheme it would have benefitted myself at the end of the day. As I add onto this into the future, I will also make sure to add the variables in.
